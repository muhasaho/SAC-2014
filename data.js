    "Title":"HealthSouth Scandal",
    "Abstract":"By 2003, Healthsouth was the largest publicly traded healthcare company in the US. The company recorded almost $4.5 billion in revenue. Later that year, its founder, Richard Scrushy was believed to have inflated the profits of the company by almost 1.4 billion. The stock price of the company plummeted and thousands of investors lost millions of dollars in the process. Aaron Beam, the co-founder and the first CFO of the company, pleaded guilty to his role in the Healthsouth scandal. Former CEO Richard M. Scrushy denied any part in the fraud. In 2005, Scrushy was acquitted of all the 36 counts of accounting fraud in relation to Healthsouth and he continues to maintain his innocence.\nMost white-collar crimes are usually set off when people begin to rationalize their incorrect acts and practices. The basis of this paper is to present a real-life example to illustrate how rationalizing improper practices eventually lead to hardcore fraud.",

Adelphia eventually reached annual revenues of $3.6 billion and was the sixth largest cable provider in the country.The company seemed incapable of doing wrong. John Rigas was revered in the cable business. He was one of the first in the industry to start stringing wires and urging customers to discard their rabbit ears in the early 1950s. A community-oriented philanthropist, Rigas was inducted into the Cable Television Hall of Fame in 2001.In March 2002, however, Adelphia 's rise was cut short. The company revealed it had borrowed nearly $2.3 billion through various family-owned partnerships off of its balance sheet. An SEC investigation followed. John Rigas, along with his two sons who held executive positions at the company, faced several fraud charges.How could a crime of such magnitude occur? And why did it happen? By relating the Rigas ' case to the Fraud Triangle, an academic model that explains the criteria necessary for fraud to take place, a better understanding can be gained of how the fraud was perpetrated and what preventative measures can be implemented to prevent a crime of such magnitude from occurring again.",

The collapse of Lehman Brothers had a huge impact on the United States economy due to filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy; the largest bankruptcy filing in United States history.

Repo 105 was an off balance sheet device that created short term deposits that were classified as a sale. Therefore, Lehman Brothers was found guilty of liquidating assets that could not readily be sold. The fraud of Lehman Brothers directly relates to the three points of the fraud triangle: Opportunities, Incentives/Pressures, and Rationalizations/Attitudes. ",

    "Abstract":" Throughout the history of the world, war has ravaged mankind persistently for over millennia, and has been an important element of most cultures around the world. For most societies war was despised and seen as a necessary evil for their survival, while for others war was a vital aspect of everyday life, one of the pillars that held together the ceiling of culture. Several warrior cultures have left their mark on the world and in history, but none have been more successful in integrating war into their society than the fearless Meskwaki. From the Fox Wars to Iraqi Freedom, the Meskwaki warrior has shown time and again that are mighty and unbreakable people both in battle and in everyday life. The following presentation will explain how important war was to the Meskwaki, how it shaped their culture and how it affects the lives of present day Meskwaki people. \n",

The term 'Sandy Lake' is derived from Big Sandy Lake, located in Aitkin County. Two sites were discovered here that contained cordmarked jars tempered with grit and shell. Leland Cooper and Elden Johnson were the first to define this ceramic category.  Sandy Lake pottery appeared during a period known as the Terminal Woodland Period, which dates about AD1200 to 1750. Many of the Sandy Lake sites have yet to be studied and fully analyzed.

Exocannibalism is the practice of eating human flesh from a different society, while endocannibalism is the practice of eating human flesh from the same society. The practice of endocannibalism is normally for funerary or mortuary purposes. In some cultures, it is believed that ingesting the flesh or ashes of the loved one is the ultimate resting place for the deceased. Exocannibalism is practiced for various reasons, including the belief that by ingesting the flesh of the enemy the person will absorb part of the enemy's power. It is also perceived as an act of aggression and the ultimate act of violence. My main objective for this research is to give insight to the ritualistic behavior of cannibalism.  ",

The occupation seems to date from the Late Prehistoric period (900-1700 AD) with numerous decorated ceramics. Decorated ceramics comprise incised and punctated designs on the exterior of containers. Some of these designs may be related to two successive archaeological cultures further east in Minnesota, which date from 1200-1500 AD. We suspect that the primary occupation of the Rotenberger site dates from this time span. My aim is to more precisely define the time span based on a comparison with these known styles.",

Sandy-Ota has been assumed to date strictly from the Oneota period (1300 to 1700 AD), as it represents an interaction between Sandy Lake people of northern Minnesota and the more southerly Oneota people. However, a recent dating of a pot from central Minnesota before 1300 AD leads to the possibility that the interaction between northern and southern people may have started before the Oneota period. The pre-1300 cultures of sourthern Minneosta are associated with Cambria and have a different form of incising than Oneota. Through the analysis of vessel shape and decoration, I aim to define Sandy-Ota as a uniquely occuring ceramic style during the Late Prehistoric period in central and southern Minnesota. I will reproduce ceramic artifacts through scientific illustration to properly depict their complexity. Through studying artifacts owned by the Minnesota Historical Society and Minneosta State University Moorhead, I hope to establish Sandy-Ota as a potential cultural style.",

In this culturally significant area, clusters of mounds were built by native peoples as a form of claiming and investing in their land. The most unique of these clusters, the Ranes Complex, is an extensive grouping of conical and linear mounds situated on the southern bluff of the Sheyenne Valley. The mounds were created and used during the Late Prehistoric period (900-1700 AD) and are part of the Okiedan Butte area (Holley 2008).  When the site was originally recorded by T. H. Lewis in 1890 a total of 19 mounds were documented, currently only a few remain visible. The general pattern of the mounds at the site is still evident although it has been altered by weathering and cultivation.  Interpreting the complex 's arrangement in relation to the rest of the area is beneficial to understanding the American Indian 's use of the Northeastern Plains.   ",

Her sacred fruit was the apple and when one cuts the apple in half, the seeds create a pentagram. Wiccans, Neopagans and Roma gypsies still use it. Pythagoras used the pentagram to identify his followers. Worshipping Kore continued into 4 th  century Egypt and in England. It used to represent the first five books of the Torah. For Christians, it has represented Christ 's five wounds, Emperor Constantine 's seal, on Sir Gawain 's shield for the five knightly virtues. It made the switch from good to bad in the 15 th  and 16 th  century during the witch trials. Today it is used by Wiccans and other neopagan religions.

    "Title":"The Feminist Art Movement: The Role of Hannah Wilke ",
    "Abstract":"The focus of this paper is the feminist artist, Hannah Wilke (1940-1993). Although, for over 20 years Wilke produced drawing, printmaking and sculpture, her best known work is in photography. Subjects addressed in her photographs include illness, ideals of beauty, sexuality, and nature. In some photographs, she incorporates sculpture into the photography. In others, she documents her mother's battle with cancer as well as her own battle with the same disease. These are often some of her most moving works. \n\nThis paper analyzes aspects of her life that have acted as scaffolding and inspiration for the themes and subjects of her work. I will also look at how her work in photography specifically impacted and changed the feminist art culture. For her series, S.O.S. (Scarification Object Series), she had her audience chew pieces of gum, shape them into small sculptures resembling genitalia, and stick them on her body. The gum sculptures acted as scars representing objectification and labeling, which are themes of her work. Minute details in her photographs have significance to the message delivered. To her, gum is the perfect metaphor for the American woman  €“ chew her up, get what you want out of her, throw her out and pop in a new piece. In other photographs she stages her body in pre-established environments and becomes part of that environment. The combination of the environment and small details work together to send her intended message.\n  ",

    "Title":"Re-Imagining the Role of African Americans and Women in Contemporary Art",
    "Abstract":"My paper focuses on the art works of Renee Cox and Faith Ringgold. I compare how each woman takes on the issues of feminism and how African Americans are visually represented in their art. For example, Faith Ringgold incorporates well-known figures from African American history such as Rosa parks and Madame C.J. Walker alongside well-known Caucasians like Vincent Van Gogh in her quilts. Renee Cox integrates her own image into historical scenes where African Americans are not commonly featured (such as the Last Supper or the Pieta ). Ringgold is an activist, artist, and teacher. Born during the Great Depression, she yearned to combine elements of her culture with her life and her art. Through her quilt compositions she revisits the fondest memories of her childhood and expresses her political beliefs. She has a broad use of color in her quilts and an array of compelling settings in which to tell her stories. Originally from Jamaica, Cox assumes a more provocative role in the contemporary art world. She frequently uses herself as a model and displays attributes like courage and dominance in efforts to empower women. Moreover, Cox invokes controversy for the sake of challenging sexism and racism. Her alter egos  Yo Mama (an empowered, typically nude or pregnant mother) and Raje (a Wonder Woman-esque character who fights racism) are key elements in this effort. Although distinct in their approaches, I will argue that the two artists share the same end goal: racial equality, gender equality, and recognition.  ",

This collaborative art goes deeper than creating awareness about social problems. Instead of shedding light on the issue of homelessness, it gives a voice to the youth who are experiencing it. I examine a few projects geared toward guiding children struggling with homelessness to produce art. These projects focus on providing tools to children to be catalysts for social change. One of the projects I highlight is a photography collaboration initiated by photojournalist Jim Hubbard and youth living in homeless shelters in Washington D.C. and Virginia. Shooting Back is a photographic documentary about homelessness from the perspective of children experiencing it. When the act of art making moves from the hands of the professional artist to the hands of the child the artwork becomes an avenue to help the child cultivate a voice. The child has the power to reveal who they are and how they see themselves instead of being a subject in artwork. A similar project investigated is Critical Exposure. Multiple non-profit organizations and companies have arisen from the homeless crisis and actively addressed the problem by nurturing creativity within the afflicted population. Artist and Homeless Collaborative and Juxtaposition Arts are, among others, two of the organizations reviewed.",

In this paper, I will examine the major subjects of cultural identity and post-colonialism, along with other themes present within their work. Mutu is a Kenyan born mixed media artist living in Brooklyn, New York who creates magical yet grotesque collages, paintings and installations. Her work explores the topic of cultural identity by challenging representations of the black female body in Western society within a feminist context. Shonibare on the other hand is a Nigerian-British artist who also works with a wide range of media and is well known for his use of African textiles. The headless mannequins that he dresses in handmade Victorian style costumes are the most striking sculptures he has created by far. Shonibare utilizes these textiles in order to challenge issues surrounding post-colonialism in terms of race and class, within the context of globalization. Shonibare 's artistic style is polished and enchanting whereas Mutu 's is provocative and unearthly, making them ideal for comparison. I will also analyze the aesthetic quality of their work and how this quality shapes their themes.",

    "Abstract":"My research is devoted to the contemporary artist Janine Antoni. She works in many media including performance, sculpture, and photography. Antoni emphasizes the process of creating art and how the beginning product correlates with the end product. I will examine how she uses her own body as a tool in many of her artworks.   For example, she utilizes her mouth, hair, eyelashes, and even brain waves to create unique pieces. She also includes ordinary activities such as eating and sleeping into her pieces. Although her work focuses mainly on the body, it also addresses the subject of power and femininity.\nOne of her most famous works is Lick and Lather, which consists of self portrait busts made of chocolate and soap. She licks the chocolate busts and lathers the soap busts to reshape them using her body. Antoni experimented with chocolate in another piece titled Gnaw. For this work, she bites out of two giants cubes, one made of chocolate and the other lard, showing how her mouth and teeth transformed the piece. In yet another work called Loving Care, Antoni used her hair as a paintbrush. She incorporated hair dye as her paint and her hair as the paintbrush. Once again, the artist 's body serves as a tool while also cleverly referencing the male heroic gestures of abstract expressionist painter Jackson Pollock. By examining these examples of her work, I will argue that Antoni engages the viewer in a unexpected way through process and material. ",

    "Abstract":"My presentation will focus on photographers Cindy Sherman and Nikki Lee. In their works, each artist employs her own body to comment on women in society. They utilize make-up, clothing, props, and backgrounds to transform themselves into various stereotypes of women. Sherman disguises herself in form of aristocrats, degenerates, generic B-film characters, and figures from history. By using herself instead of models, she shows that women can take on more than one persona; they can be mothers and daughters, executives and hourly workers. Lee also uses herself as model; however, she becomes the personas in her photographs. For her Projects Series, Lee immersed herself in various subcultures of society, and used a point-and-shoot camera to photograph different situations. By doing so, she has shown that one 's sense of identity can change, whether consciously or not. My paper will argue that while each artist takes a different approach to exploring identity, they both use the photograph and themselves as subjects of the art work to convey their messages.",

The works of Giotto, Giovanni di Paolo, Luca Signorelli, and Michelangelo are all considered as they incorporate Dante 's work in various ways. Cross-Disciplinary research between the fields of Art History and Literature are important in revealing the way Dante 's audiences might have viewed and understood both the paintings and the literature in the centuries following the Divine Comedy 's publication. Rather than looking directly at illustrations of the Divine Comedy, the examination of Last Judgment scenes by artists who were influenced by or familiar with Dante 's work, provides a different perspective of how ordinary people viewed and processed images that were normally only available in expensive codices for the elite. Especially enlightening are the presence of Classical characters in medieval art and the evolution of nude figures in Last Judgment scenes from being relegated to the damned and then spreading up into the elect after the Divine Comedy was published.

The iconography of Hell can be traced to ancient pictorial traditions found in Egyptian tombs and Mesopotamian demon carvings, contemporary judicial and theatrical practices, and literary sources such as the popular Christian Visions of Heaven and Hell and Dante 's Inferno. As established motifs and compositional formulas passed chronologically from artist to artist, depictions of the Last Judgment changed as each individual brought his own innovations and meanings to the genre. Initially used by the Catholic Church to combat external heresies, these images developed from being a didactic tool to serving as an outlet for individual artists personal interpretations of the Last Judgment scene.",

    "Abstract":"This document was inspired by the tumblr blog titled Ugly Renaissance Babies, which displays images of infants painted in the Renaissance that can be described as static, stiff, sickly, anatomically awful, or simply ugly. Oddly these babies were painted in tandem with the increased level of realism and anatomical correctness that was characteristic of the Renaissance period. Stranger yet, they remained unchanged while renderings of older humans grew more sophisticated and realistic. Sometimes even within the same painting a malformed Christ child was painted in the arms of an elegant idealized Madonna. This disparity forces one to ask, why are these infants unaffected? Especially when so many are of Christ, the center European spirituality and religion.\nThis document addresses those questions by positing that the conventional use of pattern books by painters, the prevailing views on originality, and religious experience were the primary propagators of these babies. The image-maker 's industry, the use of pattern drawings and their transmission, and the role of the religious patron 's demand for experience inducing imagery are examined to show that there may not only have been reasons for ugly babies but also preferences for them.

    "Abstract":"A majority of today 's athletes are looking for an extra edge to become bigger, faster, and stronger. Disregarding some of the illegal ways to achieve the aforementioned goal, the common choice for athletes often becomes the use of nutritional supplements, specifically protein supplement beverages. Athletes use high protein diets to build muscle mass via the combination of intense physical exercise routines and/or the use of protein diets and meal replacement shakes. Losing a significant amount of body weight can also become a major factor in the athlete 's quest to improve physical stature.   When athletes don 't truly know what they are putting in their body, or what effects an overabundance of protein can have on body systems (particularly the renal system), harmful effects can take its toll on the body. The purpose of this literature review is to investigate both the positive and negative effects of high protein intake in conjunction with intense physical activity exercise and weight loss.

    "Title":"Rhabdomyolysis - A Literature Review",
    "Abstract":"Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by muscle fiber breakdown. The breakdown of the muscle fibers can lead to myoglobin and enzymes being released via urine excretion. Rhabdomyolysis occurs when they body is pushed beyond its physical performance limits in extreme conditions such as high humidity and heat. A key sign of rhabdomyolysis is a cascade event that can eventually lead to death if the condition isn 't detected early enough. Signs and symptoms for rhabdomyolysis are dark cola-colored urine, bilateral muscle soreness, severe pain with musculoskeletal movement, and swelling in the muscles. Rapid medical treatment is required to prevent kidney failure and includes IV, monitoring of urinary output, mannitol, and loop diuretics. Without immediate medical treatment, serious complications are imminent with rhabdomyolysis, including death. Preventative measures are paramount with regard to avoiding major health complications with rhabdomyolysis; however, the most important of these is making sure that athletes, athletic trainers, coaches, personal trainers and strength and conditioning coaches are well educated about rhabdomyolysis. \n",

    "Abstract":"The Adonis Complex, or muscle dysmorphic disorder, is a mental health problem that affects males 19-24 years old.   The disorder has obsessive-compulsive traits as well as characteristics of eating disorders.   Muscle dysmorphic disorder is a psychological belief by a muscular individual that he (or she) is physically much smaller than their own actual body size. Muscle dysmorphic disorder can begin during childhood; children often look up to the muscle-bound heroes in movies and video games.   Children can also be bullied into feeling smaller than their actual stature. Known criteria for this condition include an obsession with diet, working out long hours, embarrassed feelings regarding their own body, and feeling inadequate. Negative consequences of muscle dysmorphic disorder include hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, sleep disturbances, agitation, social phobias, panic disorder, and dysthymic disorder. Implications for athletic trainers include having an awareness of the disorder along with the ability to differentiate between the demands of the sport and the preoccupation of the disorder. It is important for athletic trainers to recognize the problem early because this may be a reversible disorder.   ",

Having four potential stages, migraines affect every individual in a different and unique way.  Someone with a long history of suffering from migraines may be able to detect warning signs hours to days before a migraine attack.  Although it may seem hard to battle the lengthy list of complications associated with migraine headaches, many athletes are able to manage their signs and symptoms and continue to play at a very high level.

There are also two other ways to perform blood doping called homologous and rHuEPO. Blood doping was first discovered in the 1970 's when tests were being performed to try and increase VO2Max. Shortly thereafter, it was discovered that blood doping was already being used in international competitions. This literature review highlights how each type of blood doping technique works and which athletes have utilized the various techniques for the purposes of gaining an advantage over their competitive counterparts.

    "Abstract":"We are studying how temperature influences ecological rates of larval midges, which are the most diverse and productive insect group in Arctic Alaska.  Given the Arctic is warming faster than other regions of the world, how temperature impacts their growth, development, and survival may be important.  Using aquaria chillers and heaters, we were able to set up a gradient of temperatures ranging from 5  o C to 30  o C and assess how that impacts ecological rates of these animals. We tested arctic midge community response by incubating bulk sediments at different temperatures to see which species survived and/or grew.  We also used the midge Chironomus dilutus, a common laboratory midge, to assess how temperature differentially impacts growth and survival.  The Temperature Size Rule (TSR) suggests that development is more sensitive to temperature than is growth, and subsequently insects in colder environments are larger than those in more temperature environments.   To test TSR, we used macrophotography to estimate size of animals after treatment.  Development was measured as time-to-emergence.  We anticipate our findings will lead to direct experiments on the metabolic effects related to temperature. ",

    "Abstract":"Convict cichlids are small freshwater fish from Central America. Like most fishes, larval cichlids have a skeleton made of cartilage that ossifies into bone as they grow and become juveniles. Past research at MSUM has shown that the timing of ossification is earlier for fish from Costa Rica (CR) than for fish from Nicaragua (NI). As is commonly the case in these kinds of comparative studies, we hypothesize that both divergent genes and inducible environmental effects play a role. The earlier that prey adapt to the prevailing predation climate the higher their chance of survival. In prior research eggs of convict cichlid conditioned with an injured conspecific cue employ anti-predator tactics more efficiently than those eggs that were treated with the control thus increasing their chance for survival. In this experiment, we will test convict cichlid embryos for developmental responses to three test cues: injured conspecific cue (alarm cue) mixed with a novel predator odor, alarm cue, and a control cue (dechlorinated water).",

    "Abstract":"Over the past few decades, various species of bee have been under close scrutiny by researchers.  This is due to the fact that nature 's most important pollinators have been declining rapidly.  In order to better understand why this has been happening, researchers have developed a system of identification processes, including DNA barcoding, to track and log various species.  Since many species of bee are phenotypically difficult to identify, DNA barcoding has become a widely used system of identification.  Although many bees can be identified using this barcoding system, it is estimated that 70% of the estimated 20,000-30,000 species of bees world-wide still do not have an accurate method of identification for them.  The focus of our research is to develop and streamline a process for DNA barcoding that will allow identification of lesser known species of bee.  We isolated the DNA from a single leg of each bee collected.  From there we used our modified PCR protocol to amplify the barcoding section containing the cytochrome oxidase one gene, which was our targeted gene.  To generate barcoding data to compare with published sequences, the PCR products were submitted to a sequencing facility. ",

We are studying parasites that use fish-eating birds as a final host, a snail, and then a fish (fathead minnow).

Inside the fish the larvae encyst as metacercariae where they wait for the fish to be eaten by the bird to complete their life cycle. We are examining two parasitic species. One, commonly referred as 'black spot', form metacercariae covered in melanin that reside within the skin tissue of the minnow and can be seen externally. The second, known as white metacercariae, appears identical in shape and size but lacks melanin coating and encycts within muscle tissue. Are these two forms of metacercariae the same species? To test this question we dissected fathead minnows and collected white and black metacercariae. We have successfully extracted DNA from tissue samples and have begun optimization of protocols to sequence a species-specific genetic variant of the cytochrome c oxidase I gene.

The Sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is an important protein involved establishing and regulating the pH gradient across the plasma membrane. One of the hallmarks of cancer is uncontrolled cell division resulting in tumors. Cell division requires a series of signaling pathways to be activated in order for proliferation to proceed. A specific pathway of interest is a mitogen activating pathway consisting of extracellular-signaling regulating kinase (ERK) which phosphorylate NHE1 at serine 770 and 771. These sites were removed and mimicked through changing the serine into an alanine and aspartic acid respectively. These engineered DNA sequences will allow us to control which phosphorylation sites are present within the NHE1 DNA sequence. The different mutant NHE1 DNA constructs were genetically inserted into PS120 cells, which are cells that do not express NHE1. Using this new DNA, six mutants allowed us to test for growth and proliferation of cancer cells with and without ERK.",

    "Abstract":"Asymmetric cell division leads to the differentiation of daughter cells by aligning the mitotic spindle to polarized fate determinant cortical domains during mitosis. In Drosophila neuroblasts, cell polarity is established through the Par complex protein Bazooka (Baz aka Par-3) binding to Inscuteable (Insc), while proper mitotic spindle orientation is established through Partner of Inscuteable (Pins) and the G protein, Gai. Loss of any component leads to loss of polarity and subsequent lethality in the developing fly. Although these interactions are fundamentally important, the physical nature of Insc 's interactions with its binding partners is poorly understood. To explore this idea further, we asked: What are the interaction interfaces between Insc and its binding partners? We identified and characterized the minimal interaction interface between Insc, Baz, Pins, and G&alpha;i by MBP affinity chromatography using different constructs of Insc and assaying for binding of the partners. Our study of Insc has revealed that Pins/Insc binding is conserved with their mammalian orthologs using a motif within the ankyrin repeat 1 -; 2 region. Baz/Insc binding requires folded Insc ankyrin repeats 2 -; 3 plus one adjacent ankyrin repeat. G&alpha;i binds to Insc in a GoLoco-like manner in the ankyrin 3 -; 4 linker. We find that Insc competes with GoLocos for Gai binding. We also find Insc/Gai binding to be nucleotide specific. Using this data we will generate point mutants, which disrupt the individual pathways and look for phenotypes in the developing fly.",

    "Abstract":"Being near the bottom of the food chain, benthic macroinvertebrates play an important role in driving production in an ecosystem; they are used to determine the integrity of aquatic ecosystems due to their diversity and species-specific responses to environmental conditions. It is no surprise that fish rely heavily on benthic macroinvertebrates as a food source. The quality of nutrients and energy being passed up to fisheries depends on benthic macroinvertebrates that are primarily predatory, though they are also omnivorous because they have an intermediate position in food chains. Understanding how temperature changes affect feeding behaviors may be important under future scenarios of climate change. I want to find out how temperature can influence diet preferences in a group of primarily predatory, though sometimes omnivorous, midges called 'tanypods'.  Because warmer temperatures positively correlate with higher metabolic rates, I hypothesize that tanypods cultured in warmer temperatures will preferentially have a carnivorous diet; conversely, tanypods cultured in cooler water will experience a more herbivorous diet because it requires less energy.

From the start of this long-term painted turtle ecology study, a marked decline in turtle numbers has been recorded in addition to higher water depths, less aquatic vegetation, and newly introduced cow grazing and plowing in the area surrounding one slough. During the 2013 field season extending from 15 May to 15 September, 61 buccal swabs were collected in order to examine population dynamics more closely with the inclusion of genetic data. Buccal swabs were used because they are the least invasive method for obtaining DNA. The goal of this study is to refine our PCR techniques for processing the DNA from these swabs in order to establish a baseline of genetic diversity across the landscape. Ultimately, we aim to discover if decreased movements and the influence of the changing habitat will change the level of gene flow within and between the sloughs. Additional swabs will be collected in the coming field seasons to see how/if the level of variation/relatedness changes with the future cohorts of turtles.",

This increase in efficiency allows C4 crops to have an increase in crop yield by using the same amount of energy as C 3  plants.  PPDK is a vital enzyme in the C 4  photosynthesis pathway. It is activated and deactivated by a regulatory enzyme called pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase regulatory protein (PDRP).  PDRP has unusual properties which allow it to perform both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation making it a rare bi-functional enzyme. The goal of our research project is to investigate the biochemical properties of uncharacterized PDRP-7 enzyme found in maize. Several major experimental techniques will be utilized for the purification and analysis of PDRP-7 in maize leaf tissue, including an assay to measure the enzymatic activity, and western blots to confirm the desired enzyme is present. Preliminary enzyme assays show that PDRP-7 has a protein phosphorylation activity. Follow-up results will be presented.",

    "Abstract":"Metabolic rates are predicted to scale in a predictable way with environmental temperatures.  If temperatures are globally increasing, it means frogs, like other ectotherms, will likely be subjected to warmer temperatures and subsequently higher metabolic rates.  The rate at which frogs can metabolically process pesticides will subsequently increase; however, we do not know whether anabolic or catabolic processes might be more sensitive to higher temperatures.  We have designed an experiment to test the hypothesis that these metabolic rates are asymmetrically influenced by temperature in leopard frog (Rana pipiens) tadpoles.  We are using a two-factor crossed design with the first factor (pesticides) having four levels (malathion, glyphosate, malathion + glyphosate, and water as a control).  These pesticide treatments are crossed with a second factor, temperature, which has three levels: 20o, 25o, and 30o Celsius. Growth, development and survival will be measured for 12 weeks at three week intervals. We anticipate at the end of the research we will see lower growth, developmental and survival rates in pesticide treatments, especially at higher temperatures due to the rate of increase in metabolic activity required to process pesticides.

    "Abstract":"Meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) prefer open, grassy habitats and use above-ground runways for their movements through vegetative cover.  A variety of mice and shrew species also use these habitats, but they are not necessarily tied to runways.  If vole runways or their associated vegetative cover are blocked or destroyed by habitat manipulation or other means, vole movements might be curtailed.  My experiment is going to test if mown pathways will negatively influence meadow vole movements, essentially serving as a barrier to normal movements.  We will live trap small mammals in a grid pattern before and after we insert mowed pathways.  To track movements, we will give each individual a unique toe clip number and record distances traveled between recaptures.  I will test two hypotheses: that the mown paths will affect vole movements and that the mown paths will have a greater effect on movements of meadow voles than on movements of other small mammal species also using the habitat but not confined to runways.

Captured turtles were weighed, sexed, measured, marked by scute notches (and PIT tags starting in 2006), and released on the shoreline of the slough of capture.  From 2001-2010, we live-trapped 2 sloughs that were &lt;1 km apart and roughly 3 ha and 6 ha in size. From 2011-2013, a third slough (&lt;0.4 ha) was trapped approximately halfway between the 2 original sloughs where cattle grazing had been excluded and shoreline vegetation was intact.  The purpose of this poster is to develop growth models for our captured turtles.  Since 2001, we have nearly 4,000 recorded captures.  However, for our models, we only used turtles that had been PIT tagged and were caught multiple years.  We separated the data set by sex because painted turtles exhibit sexual dimorphism in size, with adult females being larger than adult males.  Although we took multiple shell measurements, for our purposes here, we used only use carapace length.  Our poster will present several different growth models for painted turtles.      ",

Convict cichlids form monogamous pair bonds and have biparental care of their free-swimming young for up to six weeks. During this time parents cooperate in the defense of the young against brood predators. If the young are separated from their family then they must quickly find their way back to avoid being eaten. Here we tested the ability of larval fish to use chemical cues to orient toward their family. Previous research showed that they can orient to chemical cues from their home aquarium, which comprise the odors of the parents, their siblings and the gravel in the tank. In this experiment we showed that they can orient toward the odor of an individual parent. We then showed that they can distinguish between an unrelated parental female blank water control. We also found that young cichlid showed no preference between the odor of their biological mother or the odor of an unrelated parental female.",

    "Abstract":"Urban Canada geese (Branta canadensis) are becoming too numerous in many places, including the Fargo (ND)/Moorhead (MN) area.  Since 2010, we have monitored nests and oiled eggs on land owned by American Crystal Sugar (ACS) in Moorhead which has year-round open water in holding ponds and minimal numbers of predators, providing optimal breeding habitat. Betweeen the years of 2010-2013, we quantified goose numbers (March-April), monitored nests (April-May), and oiled (April) all but 1-2 eggs in each nest as part of a long-term management plan to curb goose numbers.  Between 2010-2012, the number of nests declined from 123 to 28. However, in 2013, nest numbers jumped to 52. Mean clutch size (5.9, 5.8, 5.1, 5.8) and range (1-12, 3-14, 1-13, 2-10) have remained fairly stable over the 4-year period. Counts of geese decreased since 2010 with maximum counts approaching 440, 250, 300, and 274 for each year, respectively.  Comparing nest numbers with numbers of geese on the premises indicate many of the geese using the habitat are not necessarily nesting there.  Concurrently, but separate from our study, any remaining adult geese and/or hatchlings still present on the property by late June of each year were rounded up and removed.  The combination of egg oiling and goose removal has reduced goose numbers, but long-term effects are not yet known.  Possibly, the vacated habitat on ACS grounds will be re-populated with other resident geese in the Fargo/Moorhead area.  Nest monitoring is expected to continue through spring 2014.",

The calcineurin B homologous proteins (CHP1 and CHP2) appear to be essential cofactors to support NHE1 function. CHP1 appears to be expressed ubiquitously in healthy tissue, while CHP2 is predominantly expressed in tumor cells. While both CHP isoforms are highly homologous and bind in nearly identical regions on NHE1, each has been identified to have a distinct impact on NHE1 function. In this study we investigate the ability of CHP1 and CHP2 to bind independently and competitively to NHE1. The impact of serum deprivation has been thought to drive CHP2-NHE1 transport and the effect of low serum on CHP1/CHP2 interaction with NHE1 will be assessed. Using recombinant fusion CHP1, CHP2 and NHE1 proteins a reconstituted-96 well plate based assay has been developed to quantitate the binding affinity of each CHP isoform for NHE1. We will also demonstrate the competition binding between CHP1 and CHP2 for NHE1 using this in vitro protein- protein method. ",

    "Abstract":"The sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform one (NHE1) exchanges an intracellular proton for an extracellular sodium ion playing a key role in directed cell motility.  The regulation of NHE1 function is complex, involving multiple protein-protein interactions and several phosphorylation sites.  While most of the kinase sites have been identified the role of each phosphorylation event has not been defined in the context of the other phosphorylation events.  There are many challenges involved in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the role of the different phosphorylation events.  In part, these challenges come from the fact that data has been collected from multiple cell types being stimulated by a wide array of agonists.  Two key phosphorylation sites on NHE1 are RhoA associated kinase (Rock) and ribosomal S-6 kinase (Rsk). We have created cell lines expressing two distinct mutations at each Ser/Thr phosphorylation site.  The first mutation changes the Ser/Thr to Ala removing the ability of a kinase to phosphorylate that site.  The second changes a Ser/Thr to Asp to mimic the phosphorylation event.  To screen the roles of each of these phosphorylation sites, changes cell motility will be determined in cell lines stably expressing each NHE1 mutant.  Our goal is to evaluate the relative impact of each phosphorylation site on NHE1 function in a comparative comprehensive manner.\n \n ",

Both parents protect the young against predators for 4-6 weeks or until the young have developed the swimming ability to be able to avoid predator attacks. Swimming performance is linked to skeletal ossification (conversion of cartilage to bone), which allows more forceful propulsion. The timing of ossification can be influenced by genetics (population differences) or by envirnmental factors (chemical alarm cues: indications of predation risk such as chemicals from injured members of their species). Here, we compared the timing of ossification of embryos and larval exposed to either chemical alarm cues or water (control). We predict that alarm cue will induce early ossification because early ossification controls early ability to escape predators. ",

    "Abstract":"Fish have olfactory (sense of smell) receptors at the tip of the nose that detect chemicals in the water. The receptors connect to tracts of axons that transmit information up the snout to the brain. The olfactory tract in goldfish comprises two subtracts: the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) and the medial olfactory tract (MOT), each specializing on different classes of chemical odorants. The MOT carries information about alarm cues (chemicals released from damaged skin) while the LOT carries information about amino acids and polypeptides (food, predator body odor). Fish are not born with the innate ability to associate the chemical cues of a predator with fear; they must learn it. In this study, we will be testing whether the association between unknown predator odor and alarm cue released from shredded skin occurs if either the LOT or MOT is severed. We will use a surgical technique to open the bone plate of an anesthetized goldfish and sever either the MOT or the LOT or neither (sham). Then the hole will be closed and the fish will be allowed to come back to consciousness. We will run a conditioning trial on each fish, delivering both the alarm cue and the predator odor, to see if the fish pick up both signals of the alarm cue and the predator cue, and then run a test cue to see whether the predator odor alone will cause a fear response. This has application in environmental biology and aquaculture. ",

Captured turtles were weighed, sexed, measured, marked by scute notches (and PIT tags starting in 2006), and released on the shoreline of the slough of capture.  From 2001-2010, we live-trapped 2 sloughs that were  under 1 km apart and roughly 3 ha and 6 ha in size. From 2011-2013, a third slough (under 0.4 ha) was trapped approximately halfway between the 2 original sloughs where cattle grazing had been excluded and shoreline vegetation was intact.  The purpose was to determine if marked turtles from the original sloughs, especially the 3-ha slough with surrounding recent cattle grazing and/or plowing were moving into this undisturbed middle slough. From 2011-2013, we had over 600 captures of turtles.  Of these, 22 PIT-tagged turtles (13 males, 6 females, and 3 unknown sex) moved between the 3 sloughs for a total of 82 captures.  For 18 (82%) of the turtles, the 6-ha slough had at least 1 of the captures, and for 21 (95%), the middle slough did.  Only 6 (27%) turtles were captured at least once in the 3-ha slough with the disturbed surrounding area.  In contrast, 17 (77%) of the turtles moved back-and-forth between the middle slough and the 6-ha slough where vegetative cover was dense and continuous between the sloughs.  The lack of vegetative cover from the cattle grazing/plowing appears to be a deterrent for turtle dispersal.\n \n",

Costa Rica is well known for its highest degree of biodiversity and has many ongoing projects that are in place to conserve and rebuild what has been damaged in the past. The case of the three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata) is of particular concern, as it requires conservation of multiple habitats to ensure its preservation. It is believed that there are four populations of bellbirds around the world, and one of the largest is found in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Bellbirds utilize two separate habitats: one for breeding and one for post-breeding. Tropical rain shadow forests are areas with diminishing forest fragments and host bellbirds during their post-breeding season; due to the loss of the habitat where they spend one-half of the year, there has been a decline in the bellbird population size. Conservation efforts are being made to restore small fragments that are a second home to bellbirds and to stabilize the bellbird population size.",

We will be investigating an alternative energy practice at the UGA-Costa Rica. At the stable the family uses a biodigester that uses liquid manure and urine from cows and pigs to produce methane gas and organic material. The methane gas is used to power for cooking and heating water, and the organic material is used as fertilizer for the pastures and crops.  ",

    "Title":"Climate Change and Metabolic Rates",
    "Abstract":"Rates of global climate change are more pronounced in the Arctic compared to other regions. Recent declines of arctic shorebird populations and nesting success is correlated with the warming trend.  We hypothesize that a mismatch may be occurring in when birds arrive to the Arctic and when their food source, primarily flying insects of the family Chironomidae, becomes available. Bird migration is cued by day length, while insect emergence phenology is cued by temperature. The longest stage in the life cycle of Chironomids is the aquatic larval stage, and like other aquatic macroinvertebrates are poikilothermic, meaning their body temperatures match environmental temperatures. Chironomids are the primary food source of arctic shorebirds.  We think that earlier spring thaws and warmer summer temperatures in ponds affect the growth and development rates of the chironomids, altering chironomid size, duration of the life cycle, and timing of emergence for when they are available to birds.  Before testing this hypothesis directly, we use Chironomus dilutus, a lab-reared model for chironomids, to determine precise relationships between temperature and larval growth and development rates, as well as the effects of temperature on embryonic survival rates.  We anticipate our findings will lead to direct experiments in the field of the match-mismatch hypothesis.\n",

    "Abstract":"Tourism has introduced a host of positive and negative effects on Costa Rica economically and environmentally.  While economically, tourism is currently one of the best ways for Costa Rica to make money, if the country continues down the path of converting biologically diverse areas into resorts, its rich environmental resources will be lost.  Costa Rica 's tourism industry includes ecotourism as well, rather than just resorts as travel destinations.  Ecotourism promotes environmental awareness among travelers.  Ecotourism also provides jobs for Costa Ricans that do not directly harm the environment, like logging, for example.  Tourists looking to experience the biodiversity Costa Rica has to offer also spend money on other things while in the country, like travel expenses, food, lodging.  This increases the incentive to preserve the tropical forests that bring ecotourists in.  However, ecotourism is not without its drawbacks.  The pollution caused by the travel to get to Costa Rica can be bad enough to cancel out any of the positive effects ecotourism supposedly has, as well as any direct damages tourists may inflict during their stay.

WTL is an important scientific learning strategy because the model is designed to encourage the development of scientific literacy in secondary and post-secondary science students. The research based on the WTL model has proven effectiveness as a scientific literacy instructional strategy on small classes but has relatively no data for large post-secondary education classes. We believe that WTL can be incorporated into the large post-secondary educational classes with some adjustments to the previous model while still maintaining the effectiveness and practical aspects. We have incorporated the WTL model into Cell Biology at Minnesota State University Moorhead to test the effectiveness and practicality of the model on a post-secondary class with 150 plus enrolled students.

    "Abstract":"High levels of endocrine disruptors were observed in routine water samples taken downstream of the Fargo Municipal Waste Water Treatment Plant (FMWWTP) on the Red River. Endocrine disruptors can cause cytotoxic effects on organisms living in the water as well as stimulate cell growth. Students at Minnesota State University Moorhead have been researching this trend by observing fish development in water collected downstream from the FMWWTP. Water is collected in the winter, upstream and downstream of the Municipal Waste Water Treatment Plant. In the lab, fish embryos are placed   into three treatments:   upstream of the FMWWTP, downstream of the FMWWTP, and control water (dechlorinated water) to detect differences in development. In 2008, Medaka fish that hatched in the downstream treatment   hatched more quickly than the fish in the upstream water samples. However, further research was needed to test this hypothesis. In 2009 and 2010, river conditions resulted in unreliable water samples, and in 2011, there were no surviving fish. This year, research was conducted using zebra fish as a model organism to test for change in hatching between the three treatments. This project is in collaboration with a group of students and faculty in Chemistry.  ",

Roads provide convenient access, and illegal logging roads provide access deep into protected areas which are managed to conserve biodiversity.  These protected areas are often the only place that some endangered species exist, and many only thrive in isolated wilderness areas.  The presence of logging roads is most always associated with increased rates of poaching, as roads allow poachers to drive vehicles into habitat that was otherwise only accessible on foot.  Both enforcement of poaching laws and closing illegal logging roads should lead to better protection of biodiversity. ",

PDRP has a bi-functional role in regulating PPDK; it is able to phosphorylate and dephosphorylate PPDK 's active site. Furthermore, two types of PDRP are expressed in maize; PDRP2 and the newly discovered PDRP7, which function is unclear. Therefore the goal of this study was to (i) determine if the gene of the PDRP7 is transcribed, and (ii) if so, how much is it relative to PDRP2. The expression of PDRP2 and PDRP7 transcripts were comparatively assessed using absolute real time Polymerase Chain Reaction. The mRNA used for this assay was isolated from leafs of the Zea mays. Based on preliminary results, we have deduced that PDRP2 and PDRP7 were equally expressed.",

Today, over 70,000 people visit this forest from around the entire globe, making  Monteverde one of the most popular tourist destinations in Costa Rica. This cloud forest has surpassed the revenue of both banana and coffee exports combined. The revenue from this almost self-sustaining forest is grand enough to stimulate the economy, and many families within the country. Monteverde is a tremendous  example of eco-tourism at its prime.

Our research examines some of the characteristics of fish personality and how it corresponds to circulating hormone levels. In the first part of the study, we investigated fish performance in mazes in correlation to their circulating cortisol levels. Using a maze-based test for fish personality, we identified bold verses shy fish based on their tendency to explore. After testing this, the fish were euthanized and cortisol was extracted from their tissues. The cortisol was measured with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the second part of the study, we examined whether eggs exposed to cortisol levels similar to those circulating in a stressed mother 's body affect development and behavioral characteristics of newly hatched zebra fish. To do this, we bred adult fish, placed their eggs in petri dishes and added either water (control) or different levels of hydrocortisone and incubated them in that environment until they hatched. The exploratory tendency of the offspring corresponding to boldness was then tested in the maze. \n\n",

This study is of great interest as these large river silt deposits, produced by over-land flooding, are known to aid in crop production in the Red River Valley area. However, to date, no studies concerning potential biochemical alterations to plant growth and yield have been carried out.  It is our hypothesis that the addition of silt will increase the growth rate and overall health of the cucumber seedlings used in this study.  Plant cell walls were isolated and total uronic acid and total methyl ester, total xylose content, and physical analysis of the isolated plant cell wall material were carried out to determine any potential chemical variations to the cell wall.

    "Abstract":"Plants have inducible defense mechanisms against pathogens, which can be characterized at the molecular and biochemical level. Recognition of pathogen initiates a hypersensitive response (HR), which causes cell death at the infection site and restricts pathogenesis by nutritional deprivation. One of the mechanisms of the plant defense is a systemic acquired resistance (SAR), which provides a long-lasting protection from pathogens. SAR in plants can be compared to hormonal immune system in humans. SAR signal travels through the phloem to the upper part of the plant, where the pathogen is not present. Salicylic acid (SA) is an endogenous signal for SAR, but the mechanism of SA induction of SAR varies among species of plants. The goal of this research project is to investigate possible biochemical alterations associated with salicylic acid application on diphenol oxidase, peroxidases, and cell wall polysaccharides in cucumber seedlings.   Peroxidases and diphenol oxidases are important candidates of study in this process as they play important immunoregulatory functions.   Any alterations in enzyme activity of peroxidases and diphenol oxidases were determined using by Michaelis Menten V max  analyses.   Any induced polysaccharide alterations in the cell wall were measured using uronic acid assay, uronosyl-methyl ester assay, and Fourier Transfer Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.  ",

The plant used for the experiments are cucumbers, Cucumis sativus, which is a model system in the study of plant vascular biology and is a valuble resource in studying the evolution and function of the plant vascular system. Floodplains are crucial to plant growth world-wide, and are highly enriched with nutrients, containing 100 or more times as many species as normal river ecosystems. Plant health is largely dependent on the content of the soil, so with increased nutrient content, plants should be more healthy, therefore possibly chemically altered. Plant cell walls are formed with three layers, first being the lamella which has the primary cell wall within it, and if maximum plant size is reached, secondary cell walls form between the plasma membrane and primary wall. The cell wall consists of cellulose, pectin, and hemicellulose, with cellulose being a straight-chained carbohydrate that gives the plant cell strength.",

To optimize networks the shortest path from one node to another needs to be found. The natural world offers one solution to find the shortest path. Ant colony optimization algorithms mimic ant colony behavior for finding food and returning to the nest in the most efficient way possible. They do this by use of pheromones to mark a path for other ants in the colony to follow. The most used path with be the most attractive to the ants.\n This report is to enhance the understanding of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO algorithms are a category of swarm intelligence algorithms. I will look at different algorithms developed over the past few decades and what has been changed and improved. I will also explain the benefits and future purposes of utilization of ACO algorithms. By studying the ants, we can use their techniques to optimize our own forms of networking.",

A supportive counseling group offers an exceptional freedom of speech, as a safe and trusted environment is created. Group counseling is unique, as the group members openly provide feedback aiding in an increased sense of self and perception expansion. Due to the lack of supportive counseling groups at MSUM, a manual will be designed that will encompass health, motivation, college knowledge, and career outlook. The S.E.L.F. group will focus on freshman undeclared students enrolling in their first semester at MSUM. The group will aim to develop a better sense of self, enhance wisdom of life purpose and meaning, increase university engagement, establish peer supports, and create an academic pathway to an appropriate career choice. Lessons will focus on: readiness for change, interpersonal and intrapersonal relationships, family dynamics, personality assessment, learning style & studying tips, career decision making, problem solving & life evaluation, managing stress & coping skills, and career development. The S.E.L.F. group will provide students the opportunity to explore academic and career options, but most importantly, their authentic self.",

The purpose of this research is to fill this gap and examine the level of bullying that occurs during the college years. I am investigating the amount of bullying that occurs on the Minnesota State University Moorhead and North Dakota State University campuses and to see if there is a relationship between being bullied in high school and college. College freshman and sophomores at MSUM and NDSU were asked to complete an online survey to obtain the results. Participants were asked about characteristics of bullying (hurtful words, obscene gestures, physical altercations, and social isolation/exclusion) rather than being directly asked if they had been a bully or a victim. A total of 702 students participated in the survey. Thus far in the analysis, the results have indicated that bullying does occur on both college campuses where individuals have been identified as bullies, victims, and bully/victims. The data is presently being examined to determine if there is a connection between high school and college occurrences of bullying. ",

When institutional policy is violated or student misconduct takes place at a higher education institution, sanctions are imposed. Sanctions can surface as either active or passive. Active would be identified as a monetary fine or a reflection paper while passive would be a formal warning or a deferred consequence. Taking the time to study which method of sanctioning has the greatest chance of reducing recidivism, or repeat offenses, is beneficial to students and institutions alike. I used pre-existing, non-identifiable judicial data from similar institutions to compare recidivism rates amongst low level policy offenses. In the end, recidivism rates were comparable and both sanctioning styles proved effective.",

This paper examines the relationship between housing prices and fertility rates in Singapore by comparing the substitution and income effects associated with fertility decisions. Results of this research will inform individuals making policy decisions in response to the demographic changes occurring among the East Asian Tigers.",

    "Abstract":"Housing market instability in China has prompted fear of a price bubble and a related housing market affordability crisis since 2000. Applying an intertemporal optimization model proposed by Aizenman and Marion (1991), this research quantifies instability in the Chinese housing market. Although the Chinese government established numerous real estate policies to ensure the stability of the housing market, the regression analyses indicate that housing policies had no significant impact on the stabilization of the Chinese housing market. Alternatively, macroeconomic factors such as the growth rates of gross domestic product and the money supply, respectively, are identified as significant explanatory variables to the instability of housing prices. The ratio of median house price relative to median annual household income, known as the Median Multiple, measures changes in housing affordability. Using data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, this research computes the Median Multiple for major cities in China and provides an alternative means of investigating the abnormal housing price situation in China. \n",

Interactive media on netbooks and tablets have the potential to reinvent educational resources and create more immersive approaches to storytelling for the next generation of readers. The more old fashioned business of printmaking and publishing is far from obsolete, however. There can be arguments made for and against both electronic and paper publishing techniques, but it's important to realize that the medium in which a story is communicated has the power to alter its message or overall meaning.

    "Abstract":"The field of film studies has put forth numerous conflicting theories about film authorship, yet despite their disagreements, available theories share one feature: there is little room for discussions of women in the context of authorship.  This paper explores the limitations, and even inherent sexism, of existing theories such as auteurism (omitting women by excluding non-directors) and post-structuralism (marginalizing women by narrowing studies to their representations within the text).  By analyzing Barbara Stanwyck 's career, this paper will expose the adverse effects of this discrimination on the world of film criticism, as well as provide tools for expanding the studies of authorship to include many more undervalued artists.  To accomplish this task, I graft studies of freelance acting and fan discourse (Emily S. Carman, 2008) and the analysis of acting technique (Johannes Riis, 2009) to the concept of collective authorship (Paul Sellors, 2007).  I argue that it is immediately apparent, when concepts of independent stardom and technique are explored in Stanwyck 's films, she holds an important role as film author.  In conclusion, this paper will challenge the exclusionary status quo by offering alternative tools for recognizing, analyzing, and elevating the historically dismissed contributions of female collaborative authors like Barbara Stanwyck.",

Based on true events that took place in 2001, this experimental narrative takes a closer look into the mind of Andrea Yates by exploring what made her commit these heinous crimes. Was she an evil mother or an ill person?  Using filmmaker and theorist Maya Deren's approach through montage editing, we capture the series of juxtaposed images that correlate our ideas about the matter. Through these dream-like sequences, we take the audience through an abrupt and sometimes frightening look at Yate's mental state and speculated inner thoughts that impacted her decision in the process and planning of murdering her children in order to save them. This tragedy opens our minds to the psychoanalysis of a confused mother struggling with the conflict between her conscious and unconsciousness that materialize in the form of mental and emotional disturbances, who sought to only help her family. Our hope is to let the audience decide, was she Evil or Ill?  ",

    "Abstract":"Adaptation is neither new nor rare in film. It is the inclination of the human imagination or desire to transform a story from one medium or one genre to another. Baz Luhrmann is one of many artists that takes an existing piece of work and makes it his own. By doing so, he creates discernible patterns, or themes within his films, such as those in his Red Curtain Trilogy. The trilogy consists of Strictly Ballroom (1992), William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet (1996), and Moulin Rouge (2001), all of which explore opera 's themes of bohemian creativity, youth, idealism, and love. In each case, Luhrmann utilizes a highly stylized medium to drive the narrative: dance in Strictly Ballroom, Shakespearean language in Romeo and Juliet, and popular song in Moulin Rouge. Throughout this presentation, I draw on diverse theories of adaptation to examine Baz Luhrmann 's approach to adapting different arts, novels, opera, theater, and recontexualizing them to film.",

I demonstrate some of the similarities that past filmmakers and theorists have studied about Israeli film pertaining to war. Some of the films that I specifically discuss include, Wasted(2006) and the films of the 1960's Bourekas genre. When beginning my research on Israeli film, I found many articles on how war has affected Israeli film. drawing inspiration from the essay, Orientalism as Alterity in Israeli Cinema, I examine cinematic techniques used in Israeli films to portray orientalism while highlighting the need to have both honor and national pride in the past.

While some criticize his work as a mere exploitation of society's insatiable draw to the genre, he is still often considered one of the best at what he does.  Part of the reason for that is his consistency of style and thematic elements that find its way into his films.  The aim of this paper is to demonstrate this consistency through several of his works to hopefully pay respect to an often mocked, yet often replicated director.",

    "Title":"Chemical Activity of Nickel in Silicate Melts",
    "Abstract":"As a molten substance begins to cool and solidify within a magma chamber, elements partition between the liquid state of the melt and crystalline phases. Because the crystals have a different composition from the melt, the composition of the remaining melt changes. This process is the key process in planetary evolution. The better understand this process, we have been conducting experiments to measure the chemical activity of Nickel (Ni) in high temperature silicate melts. There were two main parts to our study. The first main part was a series of experiments to measure the chemical activity of Nickel Oxide (NiO) within a silicate melt. In these experiments, we measured how different valence states of Iron (Fe), varying degrees of polymerization (or the amount of Silica and Oxygen present), or varying temperatures will affect Ni activity, which will control how Ni will partition. Our experimental method for this part involved equilibrating the silicate melt in the presence of platinum wire, using the metallic Ni in the wire as a standard. Our second main part involved imposing a voltage to the sample, and using the currents to measure the activity of Ni2+ and O2- separately and the effects of network-forming cations on those activities. By better understanding the chemical activity of present elements, we can form a better understanding of how magma will evolve over time, which in turn can lead to understanding the history of rock over time and the stories it tells.\n  ",

    "Abstract":"The Permian Florena Shale Member lies in eastern Kansas near the center of the Council Grove Group and in the middle section of the Beattie Limestone.  It is overlain by the Cottonwood Limestone Member and underlain by the Morrill Limestone Member.  The presence of shoals formed in an ancient midcontinent sea created a restricted marine basin explaining the absence of a typical transgression-regression pattern.  Bulk samples of the Florena Shale were collected from an outcrop south of Manhattan, Kansas, and were later processed in the lab to recover both macrofossils and microfossils.\nThe Council Grove Group, composed of a moderately diverse group of fauna contains brachiopods, Foraminifera, ostracodes, conodonts, holothurians sclerites, charophytes, and fish teeth and scales.  In looking at the diversity of the fossil assemblages present in the Florena, it became evident that regression patterns directly affected the diversity of these assemblages.  From this, gradual shifting of marine environments is revealed to be present in the Florena Shale.  Also present was a decreasing abundance and variety of fossils from bottom to top with the upper part only containing a few fish teeth.  Shifting was shown by each dominant species of the assemblages having been present in different strata of the Florena with varying diversities.  The brachiopod fauna of the lower part of the Florena Shale consists of species adapted for life on a muddy substrate.  Their presence stabilized the muddy bottom and resulted in an increase in diversity in this fossil assemblage.",

We are looking at core samples taken from many different counties within the Williston Basin and are now stored at the William Laird Core Library at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks.  The purpose of analyzing these cores is to understand how they existed both spatially and temporally.  Our goal is to correlate core samples from the center of the Williston Basin to the edge of the basin, by doing this we can notice where different sequences begin to pinch out.  The objective is to put together a stratigraphic framework that will aid in the future studies of fossil distribution as well as the paleoecology of the Tyler Formation.  A greater understanding of the Tyler Formation can also help us improve the economic development potential of the resources within the formation.  By doing this detailed stratigraphy we are preparing ourselves to be better professional geologists in the area of field work.",

    "Abstract":"Yuan Shikai was not only a key figure in the dissolution of the Qing Empire, but he also played a crucial role in the abortive 1898 reform. Emperor Guangxu, influenced by reformers like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, proposed many educational reforms as well as plans for modernizing both the Qing government and army during 1898. These reforms, while promising to strengthen China and perhaps undo the effects of the unequal treaties, also threatened the established Manchu order, often represented by the Empress Dowager Cixi and her subordinates. In the conflict between conservatives and reformers, Yuan Shikai was important because of the military power he had gained through his role in the modernization of the army. This presentation examines not only the political layout of the 1898 abortive reform, but also reviews Yuan Shikai's personal view of the reform, his position and interest in 1898 that led him to his decision of siding with the conservative Manchu order.

In fact history is full of instances and long periods when laws were heavily biased against women; ironically it 's still the same in few nations! All good things start with courage. Likewise, feminist movements in developed countries brought new hope for women. Gradually they started to assert their right for equality and ascended from  'weaker sex ' to  'fairer sex '. The women 's journey from  'Kitchen Cabinet ' to  'Parliament Cabinet ' has been very long and arduous though today we can proudly boast of much-needed gender equality in many, if not all, places across the world. It may surprise few but real wave of feminism began only in the 1960s and significantly undermined legal and social barriers which made women the 'second sex', economically and legally subordinate in all spheres of life. Look at the scenario today: scores of nations and states are governed by women, unthinkable half a century back.This presentation is devoted to reviewing and assessing women's contributions in building democracy.",

    "Title":"Money Laundering",
    "Abstract":"Globalization brings many benefits for mankind, but it also exacerbates evils. One of the unfortunate consequences of globalization is it makes money laundering become easier. Therefore, it encourages other illegal activities. Dirty money can also come from weapons smuggling, prostitution, and prohibited goods purchases such as alcohol, tobacco, etc. In addition, it comes from the corruption, bribery of national leaders and local officials, embezzlement of public officials, or by taking advantage of their positions. Money laundering is not a new phenomenon. According to many Chinese traders, they said that money laundering initially existed over three thousand years ago with the purpose of avoiding the tax court. Overall, this activity has exploded with globalization and caused many serious consequences for the economy as well as society, particularly in the developing or transition countries. In developing countries, the corruption of money laundering is the most serious problem. In contrast, the western countries consider dirty money laundering related to terrorism, which is the most concerned issue recently. This presentation is devoted to discussing the role of money laundering in the context of terrorism and counter terrorism.\n  ",

The goal for this project is based on swimming and diving meet scoring and the comparison between original and true team scoring as well as college and high school swimming and diving scores.  To model this comparison, I have compared the outcome of several dual and invitational meets from the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC) teams and from North Dakota High School teams.  There will be four cases associated with this model.  Case 1 represents NSIC dual meets, Case 2 represents NSIC invitational meets, Case 3 represents North Dakota High School dual meets, and Case 4 represents North Dakota High School invitational meets.

After searching through the market, and   days of painstaking research, the most desirable car is found and purchased. The new owner   can 't wait to drive away, but there is just one catch: it is in need of a couple repairs before it   can hit the open road. An examination needs to be performed on the costs of these repairs at a   dealership versus doing them in a home garage.

Field 's nocturne was free in form and content, focusing on mood and atmosphere and creating a tender dreamlike flow of melody that evoked the emotion of sadness and solace. Frederic Chopin (1810-1849) was enamored of Field 's idea and took up the new genre expanding it to create his own unique version of the Nocturne. Ultimately, it was Chopin who popularized the Nocturne and made it an important part of concert repertoire for pianists. \n In this presentation, I will discuss the invention of the Nocturne and the innovations that Chopin brought to it. I will focus on the significant impact Chopin had on the genre and the new approach applied to his own Nocturnes. I will examine his writing style and how it created tension and drama. Finally, I will demonstrate how his writing brought a different rhythmic profile and structure to the Nocturne.",

Over its long history, dating back to its origin in the early ninetieth century, the blues have revealed and demonstrated its flexibility in adapting to new trends and integrating new approaches.  The introduction of the electric guitar to the blues offered exciting new possibilities that look forward and backward in the blues style. In this presentation, I will discuss the blues and some of the particular characteristics of the genre, including the attributes of vocal blues.  I will then explain how electric instruments, specifically the electric guitar, began to be used in playing the blues in the 1930 's and 1940 's in such a manner that embellished the style. I will also describe the connections between the electric guitar and vocal blues as well as what components are added to the blues by the means of amplification. Finally, I will examine the use of electric guitar to play the blues and the ways in which it adds significant possibilities and interesting layers to the framework of traditional blues.   ",

He is notorious for having suffered from mental illnesses, including depression, suicidal tendancies, and bipolar disorder. In addition to several other aspects of Schumann's life his mental illness undoubtedly had an effect on his compositions. In this presentation, I will describe Robert Schumann's mental illnesses and explain how his early work, Carnaval op. 9,  is a window into Schumann's mental state and a sign of the impending illness he would suffer later in life. Carnaval  is a set of short character pieces, each portraying a different character or idea. In creating the work, Schumann demonstrated his facility with representing varying moods and perspectives. I contend that some of these pieces point toward instability in the composer's mental state. In order to demonstrate this idea, I will examine selected individual pieces to demonstrate how these specific examples, and the work as a whole, relate to schuman's struggles with mental illness.",

Several trials on human subjects were made by placing the electrodes on the right and left palm of the hand. While working with the fish, the electrode probes were placed in a small container filled with water for the fish to swim in. The first recording was taken with the fish swimming inside. A second recording was taken without the fish the resulting signals were computed to isolate the signals from the fish ECG results. In addition the use of a faraday cage was attempted, where by the fish inside the container was placed in a metal box. The research is still in progress and so far it was found that the addition of filters further enhanced the required signals. Furthermore, various factors that influence the process were identified.

This complexity prevents a true determination of the catalytic mechanisms. Using well-defined electrode geometries, it is possible to quantify the relative density of two-phase boundary sites to three-phase boundary sites, and so by varying the pattern used to generate the electrode geometry we can determine the primary pathway. Toward this goal, we first made porous composite cathodes of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-Î´ (BSCF) +Ag or SrCo0.9Nb0.1O3-Î´ (SCN) +Ag for impedance measurements of well-defined microelectrode SOFCs,. Porosity, friability, adhesion to the substrate 's surface, thermal stability and electrochemical properties of the porous films were investigated by optical microscopy and AC impedance spectroscopy (ACIS).Next, we studied whether a chemical reaction occurs between the high-performance  cathode material, SCN, and the most conventional electrolyte material, Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92 (YSZ). The conditions that favor the reaction are also determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD).",

Although foreign aid distributed in the world today is little, this paper aims to understand what kind of aid and their administration best fits a developing nation like Nepal.   In the process, the paper looks at what kind of aid is out there, the different goals of countries that provide foreign aid, and the role of the governments in disbursing the aid. The paper will review the delivery system in Nepal and make appropriate recommendation and conclusions. ",

    "Abstract":"Many serious violations of international humanitarian and  human rights law occurred during the recent wars in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, and Liberia. Tribunals and special courts were established to provide universal jurisdiction to the helpless victims in the response to the atrocities . Significant violations occurred during the Sri Lankan Civil War, which was fought between Government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Ealam (LTTE). LTTE was formed in 1975, based in the northern and eastern  Sri Lanka and led by Vellupillai Prabhakaran, demanding a separate state called Tamil Ealam. The government launched a massive military offensive in the LTTE held territories in January, 2008 which came to an end with the surrendering of LTTE in May, 2009. There are claims of war crimes and atrocities committed by the both sides during the final stage of the Civil War in 2009. The panel appointed by the Secretary-General of UN submitted a report after analyzing information from various sources, their allegations, characterizing the credible sources, and appraising them legally.

Technology allows us to do things easier, faster, and more individualized. Selecting and using educational apps as intervention tools starts off with first knowing when and how to use the apps. Selected apps should be evidence-based, matched to the students ' needs and typically used to enhance other Tier 2 or supplemental interventions. Progress monitoring should also be done to track the students ' performance and make decisions about the intervention. This summary of innovative practices covers the different ways to use apps, highlights some of the more popular apps used in schools and provides a rubric to help select apps for educational and behavioral interventions. The presenter also will have an iPad available to demonstrate selected apps. ",

    "Abstract":"The purpose of this project was to explore the effects of a self-monitoring intervention on eye gaze or the visually checking in behavior of a 13 year-old male student with ASD. Individuals with ASD often display deficits in skills such as joint attention, and attending behavior that affect their performance in the classroom, social interactions, and verbal and nonverbal communication (American Psychological Association, 2013). A trained paraeducator taught the student the target behavior, visually checking in, as well as how to self-monitor the target behavior. Intervention included using a visual prompt to promote eye gaze and self-monitoring during his special education math class. He was also observed during his math class to record whether or not the target behavior was performed. Weekly observation data was collected over an 11 week period.  The results indicated an increase in visually checking in behavior using the self-monitoring intervention based on variability, level, and effect size. After the implementation of the intervention the variability of his behavior decreased and the level of his visually checked in behavior increased. The student 's mean baseline behavior was 62% of the intervals and the mean during the intervention phase was 81%. The percentage of nonoverlapping data for this intervention was 67%, which constitutes a medium effect size. These results were consistent with previous research on the use of self-monitoring for students with ASD and indicate self-monitoring can be used successfully if implemented using best practices.",

    "Abstract":"Many studies have investigated the effects of media exposure on women 's body image. No published research examines if images of thin women accompanied by men have the same impact as images of thin women alone. Furthermore, no published research examines if media exposure can not only influence women 's perception of self, but also influence women 's perception of what others find attractive. A sample of 186 female college students was collected. Participants viewed print advertisements from one of three conditions: cars (control), women only, and women and men together. Consistent with the hypothesis, we found that women who viewed images of thin women alone perceived that men found a significantly larger body shape more attractive than women who viewed images depicting both sexes together. Contrary to predicted however, women in the control condition perceived that other women found a significantly smaller body size more attractive than women who viewed images of women only. The findings from this research will extend the knowledge about media 's effect on women 's body image and will potentially provide support for the notion that perceived attractiveness norms are impacted by media imagery.  \n \n \n \n ",

Three spelling and sound overlap conditions were presented auditorily on the study list: 1) Initial Overlap (IN) of study and target; 2) Ending Overlap (EN) of study and target; and 3) Unrelated control words (UN). Significantly fewer correct target completions occurred on the fragment task for both IN and EN overlap relative to the unrelated controls. This inhibition pattern is indicative of the memory blocking effect (MBE), which is thought to occur due to automatic activation of spelling information at retrieval. This study extends MBE to cross-modal study-test situations. Implications for encoding and retrieval processes are discussed. ",

Several studies have investigated a connection between attachment style and the ability to interpret emotion on faces. This study has currently collected data on 14 mother-infant dyads to examine a possible relationship between attachment styles and the ability to interpret facial expressions of emotion. Infants ages five- to seven-months-old and their mothers viewed facial expressions (anger, sadness, happiness and neutral) while their gaze was recorded using infra-red eye tracking. The mothers' parental and romantic attachment styles were calculated using two surveys. It is predicted that dyads with insecure attachment styles will show a different pattern of face scanning compared to dyads with secure attachment styles. In particular, insecure attachment may be related to an avoidant style of gaze to negative or threatening facial expressions. These results may have important implications for the study of attachment, especially the emotional development of infants. ",

In many cultures the 'right' side is associated with positive or good attributes while the 'left' side is associated with negative or bad attributes (Casasanto &amp; Chrysikou, 2011). However, Casasanto (2009) found that people tend to prefer a product or person presented on their dominant side. Since approximately 90% of the world is right handed, this often results in an overall bias for the right side. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether left/right placement influences the evaluation of job applicants. Right handed participants were asked to read the qualifications of two resumes (presented on the left and right) for five different job openings. It is hypothesized that right handed participants will be more likely to recommend hiring applicants whose resumes are presented on their right.",

The 5E model provides instruction that places students at the center of their learning experiences, and encourages them to explore and construct their own understanding of scientific concepts, and relate those understandings to other concepts, and to the world in which we live.  The E's in the 5E instructional model (engage, explore, explain, elaborate/extend, and evaluate) stand for specific phases within the learning cycle that start with a hook, and then has students explore a concept and construct their own learning before moving on to formal theory and application.  This method of instruction though gaining popularity is disparate from instruction found in a traditional classroom.  This presentation will serve as a model of 5E instruction following the constructivist view.  The lesson itself would be taught as part of an ecology unit in a high school Biology classroom.",

The five steps: elicit, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate are used to address student preconceptions about the world. The preconceptions are addressed by developing student competence in inquiry, factual knowledge, and organization of knowledge for retrieval and application. The 5E model is important because it helps students take control of their own learning by defining goals and relevant uses for the knowledge they have learned. The 5E lesson can be tricky to master for both teacher and student alike. For teachers, it is challenging to design a 5E lesson plan because the learning is based on the direction of student thought that needs to be anticipated. For students, it is a challenging lesson because it demands critical thinking and investigation into a topic with minimal instruction in opposition to most traditional lesson plans. This presentation will explore a lesson using the 5E model in population ecology to show practical application of this model.  ",

The objective of the presentation will be to model the instructional method, while also demonstrate its educational advantages. The 5E Instructional Method is an effective educational strategy that allows students to use their existing knowledge to confront new knowledge and create new understandings of scientific concepts. This confrontation occurs through teacher-guided and, more importantly, student-led phases of: engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation. The overall role of the teacher during a 5E lesson is to create a safe environment and activity that motivates students and allows them the freedom to explore the concept in their own way. The role of the student during a true 5E lesson is to investigate, think critically, ask questions, design experiments, and communicate their conclusions. The major emphasis in the 5E Method, and its major advantage, is that students go beyond active learning and engage in scientific inquiry. ",

    "Abstract":"In the past two years, the number of abortion laws introduced in state legislatures across the United States has increased at a rapid pace. A content analysis was conducted on responses to the question Should Abortion Be Legal? at the website ProCon.org to see what commonalities exist, if any, between the two groups and between members of the same group. The results showed that anti-abortion commenters used more personal and emotive language in responding to the question, while pro-choice commenters used language that was more distancing and objective. Consistent with previous research on the demographics and likely educational attainment of the two sides, less complex language usage was more common among those opposed to abortion as was religious sentiment, while pro-choice respondents had more complex language usage and, more often, correctly used grammar and punctuation. Abortion is an emotional issue for people on both sides of the debate, and both pro- and anti-abortion commenters are highly invested in the issue. The source of emotional response was often tied to the respondents ' belief in the personhood, or lack thereof, of the fetus and to personal identification of the respondent with the fetus. As a result of the sharp differences between the two groups and the extreme polarization of their views, any compromise between the two sides is unlikely.",

It is the 4th leading cause of death in the United States and will rise to the 3rd leading cause of death by 2020. It affects at least 16 million Americans and is increasing. It is a disease that is easy to diagnose with a pulmonary function test (PFT), but the tests are usually not ordered until the disease is in it late stages. The biggest hurdle with this disease is many do not want to quit smoking, so they do not tell their physician the truth about their smoking history and their shortness of breath until it is in the late stages of the disease and little can be done for them. When COPD is diagnosed in the late stages, an increase in hospitalizations, infections, and other bodily system failures are seen as well as an increase in cost to the hospital.  If patients are tested at the first symptom or risk factor for COPD, many of costs and illness could be prevented. Quality of life could also be improved with early detection.  There are many inhaled medications for COPD but one must be tested to find the correct treatment. A majority of lung disease and health costs could be eliminated by the simple solution of quitting the act of smoking tobacco. Prevention is the key to decreasing this disease.  \n",

    "Abstract":"Despite numerous sociological advances in racial disparity, it is quite apparent that races fully exist, especially when examining the differences in health statuses across groups of whites, blacks, and minorities. Though medicine has advanced tremendously in the last 50 years, and has become much more accessible, cross studies continuously show that blacks and minorities are showing higher rates of poor health than that of their white counterparts according to the General Social Survey. Why is that? If society, medicine and accessibility has truly advanced than these discrepancies amongst races should not exist or the differences should be minimal. These issues need to be addressed. If we are to believe that racism no longer exists, that America is an equal opportunity country, that we have made wonderful medical advances, and have effectively provided Americans with equal medical accessibility, then we need to demand a difference in numbers. We must demand better health for everyone without race being a factor.",

    "Abstract":"Mental disorders have a far-reaching and diverse effect on both the individual and family, and ultimately their community and society as a whole. Although mental disorders are now recognized as a legitimate illness by the medical community and treatment/therapy is now covered by many insurance companies, access to mental health care is limited. Most people in the United States with mental disorders either remain untreated or receive inadequate care. According to the General Social Survey, the majority of those who are unable or find it difficult to get mental health care are those of lower socioeconomic status. More specifically, women, children and those in minority groups report greater difficulty getting mental health care. The association between low income or low socioeconomic status and mental illness has been well established and rates of mental illness among the poor are high. Therefore, access for these individuals becomes a major concern particularly when the rate of poverty in the United States is on the rise. ",

    "Abstract":"Mental health in the US is an issue that keeps on popping up, just by looking around the streets. A good number of homeless people have some form of mental illness and a higher percentage of these have schizophrenia. Traditionally mental health has been addressed for centuries in considerably barbaric ways to try and understand the brain functions that are associated with mental health. This is an issue that many are ashamed of and even scared to address. The recent school shootings have been associated with some kind of mental disorder, but nothing has been done to curb this issue adequately. How else shall we understand and hopefully avoid such issues if proper guidelines and support for those who need it are not enforced or implemented? Should the government be held responsible for providing the necessary support, or should this be left on the shoulders of the family and the individual? Is the slow response from the government due to the perceptions that the public has towards mental health? Through research of several sources, a comparative study with other nation 's responses to mental health and results from the General Social Survey, I will conclude that the government needs to take a center role in addressing the issue of mental health in the country.   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  ",

That is, when the respondent's confidence increases the amount of alcohol decreases, and the same reversed. Thus the hypothesis follows as such. The data set being used consists of the opinion of the statement Job security is good, the amount of alcohol consumed by said respondent and their corresponding ages into three categories. This would either ensure the urban legend that those who associate poor job security with alcoholism is correct, in which the target audience for prevention and rehabilitation are obvious, or it would dispel the myth and further research may be needed to determine what other causes correlate with alcohol abuse. In either case, dispelling commonplace rumors, influencing policy makers, or increasing awareness of target groups who may be more likely to be influenced by excessive alcohol consumption is the main goal.",

I want to discuss information with how many different races and age groups have health issues relating to alcohol. I want to show some awareness about how even taking in one glass to one bottle per day or per week can affect ones health in more ways than one. We need the power elites of this world to understand that people who are addicted to alcohol do have health issues relating to alcohol abuse, they should seek attention to find the base reason of why these addicts are having issues in today’s society. The power elites that can do something about these issues, do not understand the extent of how bad it can get for an individual being dependent on this substance.",

    "Abstract":"Through many ways, suicide significantly impacts the lives and well-being of individuals, families, and communities. The factors influencing one 's decision to commit suicide are complex and interwoven, yet certain life circumstances or social conditions may predict the probability of suicide among different groups of people (i.e. those suffering from depression, victims of bullying, etc.). An important factor influencing perceptions of suicide is religious or spiritual affiliation: because religious groups are enormously popular within the United States and throughout the world, such groups have the power to significantly impact individuals ' stances on moral controversies like suicide. Thus, it is imperative that more research be conducted focusing on the influence of religiosity on perceptions of the social acceptability of suicide. Utilizing data from the General Social Survey, it is hypothesized that individuals considering themselves both religious and spiritual will view suicide as unacceptable, whereas individuals who do not consider themselves religious or spiritual will view suicide as acceptable. By conducting further research within this area, the social understanding of these interacting forces can be enhanced and applied to studies of social condition comparison, psychological treatment, and community-based mental health centers.",

    "Abstract":"Within the health community mental illness can be debated to occur by nature or nurture. Focusing on the nature aspect of mental illness can help to better understand mental illness and how to diagnosis it. By understanding what factors to look for in an individual who is prone to mental illness can help to improve the needed treatment that the individual seeks for him or her self. Treatment is only possible by recognizing the symptoms of mental illness as soon as possible. According to the General Social Survey, feelings of mental illness occurred earlier in life and severity of mental illness did not occur until mid-life. This is why understanding how nature can contribute to possible mental illness is important to prevent the illness from becoming more severe. Hopefully this will help individual 's futures because people in healthcare will be able to better understand mental illness and take preventative steps in order to make mental illness a livable condition.

    "Abstract":" Fifty Shades of Grey  has received an enormous amount of attention and criticism. It has been shunned for depicting taboo sexual practices, chastised for its negative portrayal of such interests, and praised for opening discussions about alternative sexual behaviors. Investigating themes in approximately thirty books, movies, and television shows, I analyze portrayals of bondage, discipline, domination-submission, and sadism-masochism. These portrayals provide individualistic, shame-based explanations for BDSM encounters that fall into at least one of four models I have found: the trauma model, the self-degradation model, the predatory model, and the fantasy model. The trauma model uses some form of trauma, often in childhood, to explain an interest in BDSM. The self-degradation model involves the character belittling, demonizing, or demeaning his or her interest in BDSM. In the evil/predatory model, the BDSM practitioner is depicted as a predator, a rapist, or evil. Within the fantasy model, a world different from our own is created in which BDSM is acceptable or normal behavior. Locked into a worldview that considers BDSM as a family of deviations that require accounts, popular novels, movies, and television shows perpetuate stigmas that attach to BDSM. They do not open spaces for considering BDSM as desirable, healthy, or acceptable sexual behavior. Through the use of these models and existing research and literature, I explore the history of BDSM and the negative attitudes toward it, the inaccuracies of the portrayal of BDSM in popular culture, and the possible effects of the continuation of the stigma.

    "Abstract":"Most people are virtually unaware of the assimilation that happened to the Native American people on the White Earth Reservation. Boarding schools were set up to Kill the Indian, save the Man; because the government wanted to take away Native American culture and turn it into a European Culture. The government did this by placing Native American children in Boarding schools where they were forced to forget their own traditional ways of living. They did this by cutting their hair and burned their clothing they were made to forget their name and language; if the children did not listen they were punished, beaten, and sometimes killed. What people do not understand is that from these devastating events that happened people living on the reservation are still suffering with historical trauma. According to Dr. Maria Yellowhorse Braveheart (2000); “Historical trauma is cumulative emotional and psychological wounding over the lifespan and across generations, emanating from massive group trauma. Native Americans have, for over 500 years, endured physical, emotional, social, and spiritual genocide from European and American colonialist policy.”",

Women give for having an abortion underscore their understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood and family life. Fifty one percent of women who have abortions had used a contraceptive method in the month they got pregnant. According to British Pregnancy Advisory Service, Abortion is legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy as long as two doctors agree under the terms of 1967 Abortion Act. Abortion is safe, complications are rare. However, procedures do have risks. To support abortion, female are more supportive than males according to the research from crosstabs.",

Although Restrepo creates a wide spectrum of intriguing characters, including Agustina, the principle character that has fallen into a delirium, one of the most intriguing characters of this story is the character of Midas McAlister. Midas is not only the ex-lover of Agustina, but also directly involved with Escobar as a large source of the funds used in his money laundering schemes. I will analyze the character of Midas, focusing on his use of colloquial vocabulary, slang, and the strong influence of English words in an effort to understand his journey from the lower class of Bogota to the higher socio-economic new money class, as well as his societal and cultural inability to gain entrance into the old money upper class where the generational elite reside. The linguistic analysis will shed light on his engagement and dialogue with individuals from various socio-economic classes and the social implications that come along with these interactions.",

    "Abstract":"It is estimated that 5%-10% of the United States ' workforce consists of heavy occupational voice users (Titze, Lemke, & Montequin, 1997). Many professional voice users are at risk for experiencing complications during excessive vocal use. One group of professionals at risk for vocal complications is teachers. When reporting the prevalence of voice disorders during their lifetime, teachers report nearly 30% more voice disorders when compared to non-teachers (Roy, Merrill, Thibeault, Parsa, Gray, & Smith, 2004b). In general, teachers may be subjected to consistent behaviors that can be viewed as vocally abusive, such as constant voice use, speaking over background noise, and vocal projection (Ng, Bailey, & Lippert, 2005). Respectively, teachers may be challenged to maintain the health of their voices.  The purpose of this study was to assess teachers ' perceptions and knowledge of vocal health and measure their importance ratings of various vocal health aspects. Results indicated the majority of participants possessed basic knowledge of vocal health, but they are not fully aware of vocal health. Results also indicated that teachers might not fully recognize or understand the importance of various aspects of vocal health. These findings highlight the need for speech-language pathologists (SLPs) and education programs to increase teacher education and knowledge of the voice and vocal health.

    "Abstract":"The purpose of this qualitative research study was to gain an understanding of speech-language-pathologists ' experiences in serving individuals with dementia-based communication disorders. The researcher facilitated a focus group with four SLPs.  The interview questions were open-ended questions related to management of a caseload consisting of clients with dementia related communication problems. Results of the study revealed a variety of themes including, referral sources, confidence in assessment, reduced confidence in treatment, general treatment barriers, varied success with specific interventions, facilitating factors in assessment and treatment, and rationale for dismissal. A discussion of the themes was included as well as suggestions for future research on the experiences of SLPs managing caseloads with dementia-based communication disorders. ",

Intervention is needed promptly for children to catch up to their peers in developing phonological processes before it has a negative effect on other aspects of language. Young et al. (2002) found that children with early language and reading impairments displayed greater academic difficulties later in life. This research may be used as a resource for SLPs who provide auditory training. A quantitative study utilizing surveys was used to seek a thorough understanding of formal training used by SLPs who provide auditory training.",

This study also sought to learn if a Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) had a client to be evaluated and treated, was the SLP using assessment and treatment protocols selected at high levels of evidence based on ASHA's Evidence Based Principles. SLPs employed in skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and hospitals in the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota were surveyed. This study implemented a mixed-methods methodology and obtained both quantitative and qualitative information via the surveys. The surveys were then analyzed for the variables under investigation and stored in a locked filing cabinet in the principal investigator's office. Results of the study showed that the current evidence available on RHD is limited. The results also showed that various assessment and treatment protocols were being used, the majority of which were not specific to RHD. A discussion of the results was also included as well as suggestions for future research on the topic of RHD.\n",

    "Abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the Communicative Drawing Program 's ten-step process developed by Nancy Helm-Estabrooks and Albert (2004) for augmenting the participant 's communication modalities through improved drawing abilities. This is a published method of treatment, meant to enhance drawing abilities in individuals with aphasia in order to use drawing as an alternative or augmentative mode of communication (Helm-Estabrooks & Albert, 2004). The participant was an 82-year-old male diagnosed with severe Broca 's Aphasia and Apraxia of speech due to a left cerebral vascular accident in 2010. Pre-test and post-test data was analyzed to determine if the individual 's efficiency and accuracy of his drawings increased and if the frequency in which he used drawings increased. Accuracy improved; however, efficiency did not improve after the completion of the Communicative Drawing Program. This may have been an acceptable tradeoff for improved communicative exchange because drawing more effectively took more time. ",

    "Abstract":"The study was a single-subject design that investigated whether a technology-based home program would improve written language abilities on a customized assessment battery. The participant was a 65-year-old female participant with acquired dysgraphia, severe Broca 's aphasia, and apraxia of speech due to a left hemisphere cerebrovascular accident (CVA). At the time of the study, she was seven years post-onset; she was considered at a chronic stage of recovery.  The pre-test and post-test assessment consisted of functional writing tasks and standardized subtests from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) (Goodglass, Kaplan, &amp; Barresi, 2000) and Psycholinguistic Assessment of Language Processing in Aphasia (PALPA) (Kay, Coltheart, &amp; Lesser, 1992). The home program was implemented through the use of an iPad application, TalkPath Writing, using a qwerty-keyboard format to both copy and independently generate the name of a pictured stimulus. Speed, accuracy, and navigational skills were markedly improved from pre-test to post-test; however, scores of subtests of copying words remained stable. The results of this study suggested that a technology-based home remediation program was beneficial in the treatment of acquired dysgraphia for the given participant. The results of this study suggested the positive impact of a technology-based home program on the treatment of acquired dysgraphia, specifically the grapheme level of written language production. ",

    "Abstract":"The transition from high school to college life can be very difficult for individuals diagnosed with Asperger's Disorder. When these students transition to college, they often leave behind educational support and structure. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the social and academic experiences of these students. The research question addressed in the study was: How do students diagnosed with Asperger's Disorder view their transition from high school to college life? The subjects within this qualitative study were identified as undergraduate college students diagnosed with Asperger's Disorder who attend a state university in northwestern Minnesota. One-on-one interviews with four subjects were used for data collection. The content of these four interviews centered on the changes in academic expectations and the development of relationships with family, peers and professors. Results of this study indicated that many difficulties exist for students with Asperger's Disorder when transitioning into the college setting. In relation to speech-language pathology, significant deficits in conversation skills and social relationships were identified. After analyzing the data, eleven codes, four categories, and four themes emerged leading to one final assertion: The transition from high school to college life for students with Asperger's Disorder presents difficulties in social interactions, academics, and independence. With the proper support, however, it has the potential to be a successful and highly beneficial transition in the student 's life.\n",

Task analysis determined if Gc, Gf, or both were utilized in each activity. A literature review was completed to locate available evidence related to the activities ' effect on cognition. This current study is a continuation of a previous systematic review completed by the second author of this study and a previous graduate student researcher (Nordby, 2013), in which the researcher assessed six brain training tools across several parameters including addressing crystalized or fluid mechanics and published evidence on the tools. The current study analyzed the following games and activities: Dual N-back, Scrabble, Blokus, Skip-bo, Sudoku puzzles, and crossword puzzles. Based upon the analytical findings of the task parameters for each game and activity and located research that supported the theoretical analyses, recommendation of such products would be valuable to clients taking part in cognitive rehabilitation therapy or as preventative measures for  aging. The application of the theory for task analysis will provide consumers and SLPs with pertinent information on activities that may promote healthy cognition in normal aging.",

Cities are looking for sustainable ways to function and grow, in order to thrive as more people move into urban areas. In order for cities to develop sustainable ways to carry out their role in society, we must examine what that role is, and how it is changing as the world becomes increasingly urbanized. This research focuses on the evolving role of the city, and society 's views on the city, from the times of ancient Rome to today.  In ancient Rome, the primary role of the city was to protect people from nature, but it has since evolved, in response to other societal needs, in modern and post-modern cities.",

    "Abstract":"Children on medication for mental health issues is nothing new in America.  As a common avenue for the treatment of mental illness or disorders, it is often one of first routes of treatment and one of the most readily available.  Lead by the dramatic increase of diagnoses in childhood Bipolar Disorder, nearly 50% of which are later proven incorrect, the number of children prescribed anti-psychotic medications is now over 942,000.  The Medicalization of America's Youth attempts to take a critical look at how and why this has occurred.  Data was collected through a number of different avenues:  peer reviewed journal articles, a meta analysis, the Food and Drug Administration, the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual published by the American Psychological Association and other publications, such as the New York Times and PBS Frontline.  Considering the severe side effects, record pharmaceutical sales, and law suits that have prompted a federal investigation, the misdiagnosis and medicalization of childrens' mental health deserves some critical analysis.  With evidence showing significant improvements based on varying types of psycho-educational therapeutic treatments, this presentation argues that medicalization should be the last resort, not the first.

    "Abstract":"Our intent is to educate the viewer on certain aspects of White Earth Reservation history by looking at the White Earth Treaty of 1867 and the Nelson Act of 1889. The White Earth Reservation land base was huge, a resource-rich land. The White Earth Treaty was designed to concentrate the Ojibwe of Minnesota to one location, encourage individual landownership and turn the Indian into a farmer. Who was the target population? How were they affected?  It was termed a social experiment. Was it a success? And if not, why not? The Nelson Act of 1889 was a White Earth-specific act of Congress, outlining the process of cession and relinquishment of tribal land. Its intent was to remove all of the Chippewa to White Earth and transform native life into an agrarian society. This soon became a land and lumber grab, resulting in an impoverishment nation, stripping the people of its rich resources and strong healthy culture.How did the Nelson Act facilitate the loss of White Earth Land and its rich resources? Who benefited from the sales of Chippewa land and resources? We will offer a glimpse into the unique US-White Earth Ojibwe history.",
