SAC-2014
========

This web-app displays presentation schedules for Minnesota State University Moorhead, Student Academic Conference 2014.

The web-app can be viewed at http://muhasaho.github.io/SAC-2014/

I developed the app as part of my presentation to showcase HTML5 on mobile devices.

Special thanks to [Sri](https://github.com/kadimisetty) for helping me fix a couple issues.
